            <p> In my Sophomore year, when I was the IT intern at my high school, one of my teachers asked me if I would set up a website for a baker in the community, who had recently started coming to our church. I said yes, and designed a simple site on Wix, and taught the baker how to operate Wix, and maintain the site.</p>

            <p>Check out the Brevis Watches tab to get the full story behind this project, but initially when I tried starting a watch selling company I built a website using Wix to sell the watches. However, eventually I let my premium plan and my domain lapse, because I wasn't selling enough watches.</p>

            <p>I took a Web Design class my Sophomore year, and our final project was to make our own complete website using HTMl and CSS. I was trying to come up with an idea, when my friend who had taken the class the year before, asked me if I would take over his project, and improve upon it. I agreed, and took <a href="https://github.com/JohnAbrahamSullivan/WSCatechism-Site"> his project </a> and completely redesigned it, and made a number of improvements, including implementing a JQuery plugin for smooth scrolling I had found online.  </p>

            <p>In the summer after my 8th grade year, I decided to try my hand at making a game. Armed with a basic idea of the game that I wanted to make, I used YouTube tutorials, and online forums to help me learn Unity and C# coding, and finished the summer with a complete, albeit very simple game, which I published on Kongregate, only to promptly sink into devestation as I got a couple one star reviews,and my game was hardly every played again.</p>

            <p> Last year in coding club, I began this discord bot, initially designing it to allow players to "fight" eachother, with different responses based on chance, as well as the varying ranks of the players fighting. Over last summer I updated this bot, and expanded its functionality to serve as my butler on our Coding Club discord server. </p>

            <p> Our big project last year was a text dungeon crawler, with different rooms that the player would randomly encounter designed by various club members. Our president at the time designed all of the nuts and bolts of the game, but I contributed several rooms, which unfortunately were not pushed to the GitHub by me, but still bear my name.</p>

        <h1 class="text-center"> Why I Code </h1>
        <p> I have enjoyed coding every since I was a little kid, and discovered Scratch and online coding tutorial websites, however over the course of my time coding, I really haven't done nearly as much as I would have wanted to. Much of what I've done has simply been websites, and a large portion of it has been simply for classes I've taken, or clubs I'm a part of. This lack of coding isn't because I don't enjoy it, or lack the motivation to do it, but because as you might be able to tell from the rest of this website, I've been incredibly busy over the past few years, and simply haven't had the time or the energy to pursue usually lengthy and exhausting coding projects. Thus most of my efforts and projects have been confined to clubs and classes, or simply never finished.</p>
